                <h3>Pinik-Pikan (Cordillera's Traditional Chicken Soup Recipe)</h3>
                <p>
                  The chicken used in pinikpikan can either be prepared in the traditional way or in the commercial way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Traditionally, the process begins with praying over the chicken for favors from the Igorot god, Kabunian. The live chicken is then laid flat or hung by its feet. The individual who is preparing the chicken uses a stick to thoroughly beat the chicken's wings and neck without breaking the skin or the bones.
                </p>
                <p> This beating is where the name of the dish comes from, as "pikpik" means to beat lightly. Once the chicken is limp, a single hard blow to the back of its head or neck is used to end its life. As a humane gesture, the chicken's eyes may be checked to ensure its death before moving on to the next step. Next in the traditional method, an open flame is used to burn the chicken's feathers off, and any remaining feathers are then removed by hand. In the case of the traditional method, cutting up the chicken is a ritual process: an Igorot elder cuts up the chicken and examines its organs and bile to determine whether they augur well
